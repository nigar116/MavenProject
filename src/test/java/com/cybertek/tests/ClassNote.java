we get all dependencies from online repositories: http://mvnrepository.com, http://search.maven.org

in the repository do not choose options that say beta, RC (release candidate)

Do we need internet to use maven, what if company blocks internet?


Companies have their local repository (local nexus), companies download and test the required libraries in their nexus first. T use maven with the local nexus, we need to get the settings from our developers, team etc.
if the company does not ahve my dependency like selenium in their nexus, I have to request them to download and add it to nexus

DROPDOWN

In selenium dropdowns are handled using a separate class: Select.
In order to create a select object, we need to pass a webelement of tag select as a constructor

getFirstSelectedOption --> returns the selected option in the dropdown (webelement

getOptions() --> returns a list of all the options in the dropdown(selected, not selected all will returned)
